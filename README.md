A lot of waste that could go to compost or recyclables end up in landfill because of peopleâ€™s negligence. In this project, our group hopes to provide a visualization tool that educates the users about waste management for more responsible waste disposal by using interactive tools and putting the current state of waste into perspective. In addition, we would like to demonstrate what impact responsible trash disposal could have in the future. Furthermore, we want the audience to form small but effective habits of managing trash as the impact of mismanaged trash has a huge potential to harm the environment, wildlife and humans.

Work breakdown:

Helen: bubble map, choropleth (and bar charts for comparing countries), video

Kalyn: drag-drop, aluminum recycling (and other recyclables) page, paper

Yuji: bulldozer image, US landfill page

Project process: We came up with a list of features we wanted to have in our project, and split the work by sections. Helen took up the world content, Yuji took up the US content, and Kalyn took the remaining work such as interactive tools to allow users to learn more about waste sorting and its benefits. We met about once a week leading up to the last week leading up to the due date, and Helen and Kalyn combined the views together.
