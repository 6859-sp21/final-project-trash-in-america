          Even though there have been great efforts to promote and encourage
          recycling and composting in the past decade, there could be better
          support on educating the public about <i>how</i> to recycle/compost. This is
          not just about having a list of items above each bin of three-stream
          waste bins. Even if something is considered recyclable, for example, a
          specific item might not be if it was not properly cleaned out.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In general, if an item can be recycled or composted, it is considered
          better to recycle the item rather than compost it since recycling an
          item reduces the amount of new natural resources that need to be
          extracted. However, even if an item is recyclable—such as a plastic
          bottle, for example—it has to be empty, clean, and dry. If you throw
          your boba cup with some tapioca balls and even a little bit of milk
          tea into the recycling bin, not only is the cup no longer recyclable
          <img align="right" class="modal-img" src="/images/recycle-bin.svg" />
          but everything that the remaining liquid spilled onto would also no
          longer be recyclable. If you take one thing away from this pop-up,
          please remember to empty, clean, and dry anything you put into the
          recycling bin. In addition, sending non-recyclable items into
          recycling centers could end up in damaging their machines; for
          example, plastic bags and greasy pizza boxes could shut down some
          recycling machines for days. Though recycling is good, it’s only good
          if you do it right.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Though recycling is good, there is a limit to how many times some
          material can be recycled and reused (for example, paper can usually
          only be recycled 5-7 times), and this is when composting comes in
          handy. In California, ⅓ of all landfill waste was actually
          compostable. Some people think that this is not a big issue, since<img
            align="right"
            class="modal-img"
            src="/images/compost.svg"
          />
          wouldn’t it just decompose in the land anyways? Yes, it would
          decompose—in a bad way. Not only does organic waste in the landfill
          take up space for other trash that cannot be recycled or composted, it
          also emits methane gas while decomposing, which is a big source of
          greenhouse gas emission today. Throwing away organic waste into
          compost bins rather than normal trash bins and properly degrading the
          waste would eliminate these greenhouse gases emitted to the
          environment.
